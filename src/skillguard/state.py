"""The graph's shared state.

LangGraph runs nodes as plain functions over one shared dict: each node receives
the whole state and returns *only the keys it changed*. LangGraph then merges
those partial results. For most keys the merge overwrites; for keys annotated
with a *reducer*, it combines instead.
